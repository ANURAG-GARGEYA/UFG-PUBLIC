Untitled flyswatter game
 
Backstory - Its a summer afternoon and your mom has baked some delicious cupcakes. She has asked you to gaurd them until she is back from running some errands. As happy as this situation looks, its not going to be so easy for you. You see a swarm of bugs led by their queen coming towards your kitchen to steal your food. You only have a fly swatter to defend your kitchen against the army of bugs, so brace yourself for a big fight.

It's an asymetric multiplayer game where one player is the kid and the other player is the bug queen. 

Mechanics : 

fly swatter killing
spawning bug army by throwing eggs
swinging across the kitchen being the bug queen
flying bugs and crawling bugs

I am gonna keep updating the readme file with anymore features and mechanics we add.
